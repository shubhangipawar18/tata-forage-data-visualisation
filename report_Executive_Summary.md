# Executive Summary – Online Retail Expansion Insights (Power BI)

## What was done
- Cleaned data by removing invalid rows:
  - Quantity < 1
  - UnitPrice < 0
- Created revenue (Quantity × UnitPrice) and measures for Total Revenue and Total Quantity.
- Built four executive visuals aligned to CEO/CMO questions.

## Findings
### Q1: Monthly revenue trend (2011)
- Revenue rises from Aug, peaks in Nov, and drops in Dec → strong Q4 seasonality.

### Q2: Top 10 non-UK countries by revenue + quantity
- Netherlands and EIRE lead revenue; Germany and France follow; Australia also significant.
- Revenue vs quantity differences suggest varying basket sizes/order values across markets.

### Q3: Top 10 customers by revenue
- Revenue is concentrated among a small group of customers → retention focus is high-impact.

### Q4: Demand by country (quantity), excluding UK
- Demand is concentrated in a few countries; long tail markets exist for testing.

## Recommendations
- Plan inventory/operations ahead of Q4 peak (Sep–Nov).
- Prioritize expansion in highest-demand/high-revenue non-UK markets first.
- Protect top customers with retention strategies and account management.
- Use smaller markets for test-and-learn campaigns before scaling.
